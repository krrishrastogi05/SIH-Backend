Project Progress Summary

1. Initial Setup and TypeScript Errors
   Problem: Numerous TypeScript errors during setup.
   Solution:

* Installed required type definitions (@types/node, @types/express).
* Adjusted tsconfig.json for better compatibility.

2. Resolving Critical Prisma Issues
   Problem: Conflicting configurations between different Prisma versions caused prisma generate and prisma migrate to fail.
   Solution:

* Simplified configuration by removing prisma.config.ts and defining the database URL only in prisma/schema.prisma.
* Fixed schema relations by running npx prisma format and manually naming ambiguous relations.
* Added "postinstall: prisma generate" in package.json to ensure Prisma client generation after every npm install.

3. Fixing Dependency Conflicts
   Problem: npm install failed due to version conflict between cloudinary and multer-storage-cloudinary.
   Solution: Installed using --legacy-peer-deps.

4. Implementing and Testing the Auth Service
   Problem: Needed to verify authentication logic.
   Solution:

* Created src/test-auth.ts to test AuthService.
* Added dotenv/config to fix missing environment variables like JWT_SECRET.
* Removed static keywords from service methods.
* Enhanced test script to check registration and login for all user roles and clean up test users automatically.
